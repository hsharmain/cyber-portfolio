        <p>Cybersecurity is a natural fit for me because I enjoy problem-solving and working with technology. With experience in Python, SQL, and troubleshooting, I analyze data, identify vulnerabilities, and improve security processes. Having encountered phishing attempts firsthand, I understand the importance of strong security measures. While I continue to build my expertise, my technical skills and commitment to mitigating risks and upholding integrity allow me to contribute to protecting systems and users. Iâ€™m excited to apply my knowledge to help organizations strengthen their digital defenses and enhance cybersecurity awareness.</p>
