        <p> I strongly consider myself a motivated person who is always interested in the latest technologies.

          Skilled at navigating ambiguous tasks, identifying effective solutions, and proactively seeking guidance when needed. 
          Equally effective working independently or within a collaborative team environment. 
          Experienced in meeting deadlines and working under pressure with a high level of awareness and adaptability.</p>
        <!-- Cybersecurity is a natural fit for me because I enjoy problem-solving and working with technology. With experience in Python, SQL, and troubleshooting, I analyze data, identify vulnerabilities, and improve security processes. Having encountered phishing attempts firsthand, I understand the importance of strong security measures. While I continue to build my expertise, my technical skills and commitment to mitigating risks and upholding integrity allow me to contribute to protecting systems and users. Iâ€™m excited to apply my knowledge to help organizations strengthen their digital defenses and enhance cybersecurity awareness.-->
